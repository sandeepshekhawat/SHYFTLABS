1.  **DSA**
Given an unbounded array (an array whose length cannot be figured out), that only contains positive integers and -1. After a certain index x, all the elements are -1. Find this index x.

``` 
Input eg: 3, 4, 1, 2, 7, 8, 20, 33, -1, -1, -1, -1, …….
Output: 8
Input eg: -1, -1, -1, -1,.....
Output:0

NOTE:
The array will always have -1 at some index
The array will never be empty
Once -1 appears, a positive integer will never appear 
```
